# Introduction

The authapi is an isolated server-side component that provides
authentication and authorization primitives. It's is completely decoupled
from agora-core, and it's ignorant of concepts like "election", "vote" or
"agora", even though its primarily developed with Agora voting use-case in
mind. It can be used for other services, completely unrelated to elections.

An Authentication Event (or auth-event) is an important concept in the
authapi. Let's explain it with an example: imagine you're creating a single
election, where you have a given census of electors, and you authenticate the
electors sending a SMS code to their mobile phones. In that case, the election
will have an associated event auth in an authapi, configured with a
census, configured to use the "SMS-code" authentication method, and the SMS
provider credentials details needed to be able to send emails.

Another important entity in authapi is an "User". Each auth-user can be uniquely
referenced by the user-id. The users have some authorization to act over some
objects using ACLs.

Authorization is provided using an Access Control Lists (ACLs) mechanism. Not
every user can create a new auth-event, and not every-one can administrate an
auth-event to configure its details. ACLs are stored in a table of the database,
with an id, a permission string, an object id, an object type, and an user-id.

With ACLs, you can for example say "user 34 has 'create' permission
of object type 'AuthEvent'" or "user 122 has 'admin' permission on object 33 of
type 'Election'", for example. This information can be extracted in the form of
an HMAC credential token that can be used by a third-party application to
verify that the given user has permission to execute any kind of action to any
kind of object.

# Installation

1. Download from the git repository if you haven't got a copy
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/agoravoting/authapi && cd authapi
    ```

2. Install package and its dependencies
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev python3-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libpq-dev
    $ mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) myenv
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create postgres database:
    ```
    $ sudo su postgres
    $ createuser -P authapi
    $ psql -tAc "ALTER USER authapi PASSWORD '<SOMEPASSWORD>';" -U postgres
    $ createdb -O authapi authapi
    ```

4. Create scheme and load initial data. This command create username admin with
password admin for initial data, and tlf "+34666666666" and code "admin123" for
saas. Not very secure credentials for a production environment (on purpose -
change it!) but works for a first go:
    ```
    $ ./manage.py migrate
    $ ./manage.py loaddata initial # you can also use "saas" instead of "initial"
    ```

5. Run:
    ```
    $ ./manage.py runserver
    ```

6. In production, for use celery, you need configure in setting the rabbitmq-server and execute:
    ```
    $ ./manage.py syncdb
    $ ./manage.py celeryd
    ```

Optional. Added some plugin:
    Install plugins with pip or by other way
    Added plugins to PLUGINS in settings
    Enjoy of your plugin

# Run unit tests

You can run unit tests by having a local `authapi` postgresql database, managed by the user
`authapi` with password `authapi` and then executing the `runtests.sh` script:

    $ sudo su postgres
    $ psql -tAc "CREATE USER authapi WITH PASSWORD 'authapi';" -U postgres
    $ psql -tAc "ALTER USER authapi CREATEDB;" -U postgres
  - $ psql -tAc "CREATE DATABASE authapi OWNER authapi;" -U postgres
    $ exit
    (authapi-env) ~/authapi $ ./runtests.sh

# Tecnical details

Technically, authapi should:
 * allow migrations
 * implement unit-tests for the API calls

Basic Database tables:
* AuthEvent
    * id: autoinc int, identifies the event uniquely
    * census: string (5), type of census: close(default) or open registration
    * auth_method: string (255), unix-name of the auth method plugin used
    * auth_method_config: json-string, json configuration string
    * extra_fields: json-string
    * status: string (15), status of auth-event: notstarted(default), started or stopped
* User
    * id: string (255), random uuid, identifies the user uniquely
    * event: auth-event associate
    * metadata: json-string
    * status: string (255): used to flag the user
* ACL
    * id: autoinc int, identifies the event uniquely
    * user_id: string (255) foreign key, to  User.id, required
    * perm: string (255) title of the permitted action. required
    * object_type: string (255) type of object to which the user is granted permission to. required
    * object_id: string (255) object related to which the user is granted permission to id
      (default=0) mean permission in all id

The authapi is extensible using modules. The mudile can extend authapi in
different entry points defined in authapi, providing:

* new authentication methods
* new pipeline
* in general, new API methods under /\<module-name\>

For create a new module: [Development guide](Development.md)

Examples:

* email (required for a minimum version)

Provides authentication by sending a custom email for a set of users.

* sms

Provides authentication using an SMS code.

# API:

## POST /get-perms

Requires a session auth-token set in the AuthToken header. Requests a given
permission to a given object type and object id  (object id not required).

IMPORTANT NOTE: if not especific id, default_id is 0. if id is 0, the user have permission about all id

Request:
    
    {
      "user": "someone"
      "object_type": "User",
      "permission": "create",
      "object_id": id
    }

    {
      "permission": "create",
      "object_type": "User",
      "object_id": "deadbeef"
    }

Response: If successful, returns a keyed-HMAC permission token:

    {
      "permission-token": "khmac:///sha-256;deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef/userid:User:deadbeef:create:timestamp"
    }

## GET /acl/:username/:object_type/:perm/:object_id
